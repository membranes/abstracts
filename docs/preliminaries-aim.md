# Aim

In brief.  Organisations identify or detect words/strings of interest within documents or data blobs for a variety of purposes, e.g., knowledge graph development, text redaction, criminal investigations, etc.  Organisations may opt for manual word detection if off-the-shelf solutions cannot address their needs.  For example, most redaction software solutions focus on detecting and redacting words/strings of a narrow set of categories, and it is rarely possible to adapt the solution to the detection of words/strings of bespoke categories.

<br><br>

A viable solution strategy involves the creation of custom models via <i>named entity recognition</i> machine learning algorithms; also known as token classification algorithms. These algorithms can be trained by domain or problem, leading to compact, domain specific, word/string detection models.  

<br><br>

This project publishes an adaptable token classification modelling set-up, i.e., artificial/machine learning engineers can fork and adapt the repositories to their $(a)$ token classification problem, $(b)$ development environment, and $(c)$ the <a href="https://github.com/membranes/text/blob/master/src/models/interface.py#L70">range of language models</a> that they would like to try.  The latter point is discussed below.
